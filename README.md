## 5G Network Architecture Simulation for Healthcare

<p align="justify">
This is the final project for the course "Desenvolvimento de Software Orientado à Computação Móvel e Ubíqua" (DT16002-00153-912009 - 2023/2) for the Graduate program in Applying Computing at Unisinos. The goal of this work is to design, implement and test a 5G Network Architecture to be used in Healthcare systems scenarios.

## 5G Healthcare architecture

<p align="justify">
The network core is implemented using the free5GC simulator to activate all network's main components (NRF, UDR, UDM, AUSF, NSSF, AMF, NWDAF, PCF, SMF and UPF). When the User Equipment (UE) devices are properly registered, they are assigned using the my5G-RANTester implementation, and all data that flows trough this newtork is stored in a MongoDB Database.

## Testing

<p align="justify">
The experiments will consist in using different network slicing configurations to demonstrate the isolation and customization of network services for various applications.
