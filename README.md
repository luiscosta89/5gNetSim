## 5G Network Architecture Simulation for Healthcare

<p align="justify">
This is the final project for the course "Desenvolvimento de Software Orientado à Computação Móvel e Ubíqua" (DT16002-00153-912009 - 2023/2) for the Graduate program in Applying Computing at Unisinos. The goal of this work is to design, implement and test a 5G Network Architecture to be used in Healthcare systems scenarios.

## 5G Healthcare architecture

<p align="justify">
The network core will be implemented using the free5gc simulator, the User Equipment (UE) devices will be designed using Mininet Wi-Fi simulator and the application and data will be injected with JSON files using React.
</p>

## Testing

<p align="justify">
The experiments will consist in using different network slicing configurations to demonstrate the isolation and customization of network services for various applications.
