# 5G Network Architeture Simulation
- Create a simulated 5G network architecture in Mininet, including the core network, radio access network (RAN), and user equipment (UE) devices.
- Inject and collect data via JSON using Python
- Experiment with different network slicing configurations to demonstrate the isolation and customization of network services for various applications.
